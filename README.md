Raspberry pi wall display including weather and indoor temperatures

### About

This is a Node Red project that is intended to be a wall display. The current implementation is running on a Raspberry Pi connected to an old video monitor mounted on the wall.
Originally this was run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. It would run on that hardware but after several days of running it had a tendency to lock up. I think that was due to the limited memory on the Pi Zero. Switching to a Raspberry Pi Model 3B solved the problem. In theory this could run on any computer that can run Node Red and a web browser.
The files are in a format that can be used by the Node Red project feature. You should be able to clone this project using the Node Red project menu.
